# Human_Follower
* This is a basic illustration to make a simple human follower bot. The tool used for this online illustration is ThinkerCAD.
* The basic idea is to connect the respective parts as shown in the schematic but placing the IR Sensor in such a manner that the sensor faces the forward direction of the bot

## Working
* As mentioned before, the IR sensor will be facing the forward direction and is connected to receive input
* When the sensor detects a heat signature of a human, it will move in the forward direction hence following the human.

#### Note
This does not cover the scenario when the human goes completely out of sight. This will be covered sooner so stay tuned!
